# Bayesian Optimization

These set of notebooks cover basic theory about Bayesian optimization and its use for hyperparameter tunning.

The slides of the presentation that covers the basic theory can be found [here](https://github.com/jdariasl/ML_ExtraMaterial/blob/main/my-book/pdfs/Introduction_to_BO_UPM.pdf).

Most of the  material is based on the tutorials by [Dr. Javier Gonzalez](https://github.com/javiergonzalezh?tab=repositories) and [Dr. Nicolas Durrande](https://github.com/NicolasDurrande), including the hellicopter lab proposed by Dr. Nicolas. Some examples and practical excersise are modifications or reimplementations of those shared by [Martin Krasser](http://krasserm.github.io/) in his blog.
