# ML Extra Material

This jupyter book contains extra material to those included on my [ML introductory course](https://jdariasl.github.io/ML_2020/intro.html) 
and also on the [Fundamentals of Deep Learning](https://rramosp.github.io/2021.deeplearning/intro.html).

The aim is to organize the material of additional topics of interest. Some of the notebboks were developed by me and many others are based
on open notebooks shared by others individually acknolwedged accordingly.
